# CS_555_C_Group_Mutables
In this project we want to implement an IOS mobile Application for the course CS-555. 
The main goal of the project is to help the player have a relaxing time during playing the game according to their mood. 
The main part of the game consists of a story with different endings according to the choices that the player makes. This makes the player to be more engaged with the story so for a short period of time he/ she can be released from everyday life mental preoccupations. 
There are also relevant audio implementations which helps the user to be more engaged with the game. The player can also have specified amount of time to meditate during the game. 
The game also contains small stress relief games like dart simulation, which are simple and regular mind engaging games. 
Besides multiple mini games, our IOS application supports two types of notifications. First, it notifies the player to take breaks after 10-15 minutes and second, it pushes motivation quotes everyday so that player can be engaged with the application even when he/ she is not actually playing. 
The scores of the logged in player is stored so that he/ she can monitor their progress and resume their game where they have left off. 
Our main goal is to make the game as simple as possible so that it will not be boring or complicated. 
The player mostly wants to spend a relaxing time with least effort and time.
